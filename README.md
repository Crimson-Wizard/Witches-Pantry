# The Witches Pantry

The UK throws away around 9.5 million tonnes of food waste in a single year and around 60% of that is from household waste.

The Witches Pantry is my idea to help reduce food waste by being able to check at any when an item in your fridge/cupboards is going to expire. By being able to check within the day/week/two weeks/three weeks when items in your pantry are expiring we will be able to have better control over the waste we produce.
